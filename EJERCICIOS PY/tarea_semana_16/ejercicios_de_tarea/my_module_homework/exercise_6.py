# 7. Create a function that accepts a list of numbers and returns a list containing only the prime numbers from it."
# "1. Example: [1, 4, 6, 7, 13, 9, 67] â†’ [7, 13, 67]"
# "2. Tip 1: Research the mathematical logic to find out if a number is prime, and convert it to code. Don't look up the code; 
# that won't help."
# "3. Tip 2: Here you need to do several things (iterate through the list, check if each number is prime, 
# and add it to another list). So the best approach is to add another function to check if the number is prime or not."
